# Forward-Modeling-Transparency-Profiles
I worked under Dr. Richard Jerousek as my research mentor to create simulation that may determine the likelihood of significant changes in Saturnâ€™s ring structure over small azimuthal length scales. The Beta Centauri occultations provide an opportunity to measure azimuthal variability in ring structure on the scale of the separation of the stars, much less than the scale of an imaging pixel, which is the motivation for the project. Occultation data of Beta Centauri would be modeled at the sharp edges of ringlets and gaps with two components for the transparency model to represent each azimuth sampled by one of the stars in the binary system. Sharp edges were chosen to directly measure the radial separation of the two stars from the radial separation of distinct edge features, one for each star passing behind the edge, which would provide an estimate for the azimuthal separation. First under the assumption of azimuthal symmetry with its components being identically separated, reduced chi-squared comparison tests were used to quantify how well the transparency profiles are in accordance with the measured data. The edges of the Huygens ringlet, the Encke gap and Keeler gap edges, and the outer A and B ring edges were analyzed. Significant variations in ring transparency between the two stars are found near edges that need outstanding changes in ring transparency for fitting over short azimuthal distances in some occultations, which was the case for the Encke Gap edges and the outer Keeler gap edge as well. In the end, we find that the models also showed a qualitative difference between the azimuthal structure of the different edge regions of the outer A ring edge compared to the outer B ring edge, and the inner Keeler gap edge compared with the outer Keeler gap edge.
